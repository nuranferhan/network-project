This project is a 2D maze style multiplayer game created using Python and Pygame. The game runs on a client-server architecture and utilizes the TCP/IP protocol to allow players to connect and interact in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal is to design a real-time multiplayer game where players can connect over a network. The game reinforces the concepts learned in network programming by implementing socket communication, synchronization, and concurrent player interactions.

Players are assigned roles as either **thieves** or **police**. The thief tries to escape within a time limit, while the police attempt to catch the thief. Various **boost items** are available on the map to enhance gameplay, such as speed-ups, teleporters, and point bonuses.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame** – For graphics and game mechanics
- **Socket Programming** – For network communication via TCP/IP
- **Pickle** – For data serialization
- **Threading** – To support multiple clients concurrently


## 🧠 Key Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Dynamic maze generation
- Boost items with effects (speed, teleport, points)
- Score tracking and countdown timer
- Animated characters and end-game screen
- Automatic new game session management
